Impementaion of FQF with PyTorch
The Fully Quantile Function (FQF) algorithm is an advanced technique in reinforcement learning
that focuses on distributional reinforcement learning. 
It builds upon the concept of quantile regression to approximate the full quantile function 
  of the return distribution.
