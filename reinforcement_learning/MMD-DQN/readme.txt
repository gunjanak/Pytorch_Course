Implementation of MMD-DQN
[MMD-DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12354)
MMD-DQN is a variation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm that incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) regularizer. 
This approach aims to improve the stability and performance of the DQN by addressing the issue of overestimation bias 
in Q-learning.
